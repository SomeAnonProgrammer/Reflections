1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	You would want to use a remote repository whenever you need to work with other or whenever you feel like sharing your work with others.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	You might want to manually pull changes because it allows you to only pull whenever there is a significant change that has been made on Github. It also more efficiently uses computer space.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks: made through the Github servers, the file doesn’t necessarily need to end up locally (used when you want to borrow/ copy someone else’s repository onto your GitHub remote)
	Clones: can be from Github to computer or computer to computer (used whenever you want a file locally or when you want to just make a copy of a file)
	Branches: can be made on local computer or on Github (used to differentiate between commits)
