1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	You would want to use a remote repository whenever you need to work with other or whenever you feel like sharing your work with others.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	You might want to manually pull changes because it allows you to only pull whenever there is a significant change that has been made on Github. It also more efficiently uses computer space.
